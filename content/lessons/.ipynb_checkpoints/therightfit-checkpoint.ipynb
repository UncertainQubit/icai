    "# The Right Fit\n",
    "Overfitting is where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, so when the model is being created, it looks like a near 100% accuracy rate; however, it does poorly in validation and other new data because it is perfectly fitted to the data that it was trained on. Underfitting is the opposite, where a when the model is being built, the accuracies are very high, similar to overfitting, but the model is missing crucial categories that define trends seen in the data and just has a very specific set of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither are desirable in a model as it greatly reduces the accuracy of the model when it is used on either training data or a larger set of data that was not used for the initial creation of the model. This eliminates the model's usefulness as it will make inaccurate predictions about what it is processing because it is missing a broader understanding of trends/patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a model built using a basic decision tree to determine house prices like the one pictured created below could be overfit if it had so many end nodes that they were each incredibly specific (i.e. 1111 Sherwood Street will sell for \\\\$111,000). When this model is used on data it has never seen before it performs poorly because it was so specified to the data it was trained on. This leads to accuracy suffering as a whole. Conversely, a decision tree with only two end nodes (say \\\\$100,000 and \\\\$200,000) would be inaccurate because it can't recognize broader trends in the data and is focused on only one or two features. Neither makes for a very good ML model. In this chapter you will learn about identifying overfitting/underfitting and how to correct it.\n",

When you test the model purely on the data it was trained with it performs extremely well (extremely close estimates to actual housing costs). However, when tested on separate validation data the model has an extremely large margin of error. Below we will explore ways to help identify and correct overfitting and underfitting in your model."

    "# Hyperparameter Analysis\n",
    "One way to identify overfitting/underfitting is if your model performs great with training data but poorly with new testing data which is why it is important to have both a large training dataset and a large testing dataset. One of the primary ways ML engineers work to address this problem is through something called hyperparameter analysis. Essentially this means trying a bunch of different values for various parameters within a model (such as the number of end nodes). This can either be done as a semi-automated process (like we will below) or as a fully automated process using services like AWS Sagemaker. "
